# Lab - CSS

Similar to the HTML lab previous, this lab is open ended as it is difficult to ever declare a project such as this as "complete". Please consider the following as MVP:

- "I have had a go playing Flexbox Froggy and now understand the basics of CSS Flexbox"
- "I have had a go playing CSS Grid Garden and now understand the basics of CSS Grid"
- "Using my wireframe from the previous afternoon activity, I have added in some styling, _including at least one example of Flexbox or CSS Grid_"

We appreciate that it may be difficult to gauge what constitutes further progress towards the usual context of _Extensions_ for this lab. Do not worry about this scoring, your self-reflection score for how comfortable you are with this content is far more important

**For submission** feel free to make use of the repo you have from the previous HTML lab. However, please do also make a copy of your original HTML document if you look to or change it at all. This is so the trainers can gain some insight into how your understanding of HTML may have changed during the process of adding CSS


## Part I: Flexbox

### Flexbox Froggy

Who doesn't love a bit of gamification? Flexbox can be a tricky thing to wrap your head around so to practice, give this game a go

You do not need to complete all levels. Please feel free to move on once you are comfortable with each of the key flexbox-related properties introduced in the teaching today


### Additional Reading

There are plenty of great online resources which discuss the basics of flexbox. We particularly love this CSS Tricks article:

## Part II: CSS Grid

### CSS Grid Garden

Akin to Flexbox Froggy above, CSS Grid Garden is an online game which aims to introduce the key properties of CSS Grid

Again, you do not need to complete every level of this game provided you are comfortable with the content before moving on

### Additional Reading

CSS Tricks also have a fantastic article on CSS Grid for if you would like some further explanation of this concept:

## Part III: Adding Styling to your Website

Now it's time to truly realise your design! Using your previous wireframe and HTML document, begin adding positional-based styling to your key design elements. Follow this up with some aesthetic properties

- Add styling to your webpage from the previous lab, taking care to try best represent what you originally envisioned in your wireframe

CSS can be a tricky one to get right. A great trick for gaining a better understanding of why your webpage may not look as intended, is to investigate the DOM using the in-built browser Developer Tools. By first selecting an element within the `Elements` tab, you can then see what styling is being applied below (under `Styles`)

Perhaps the reason an element isn't how you expect it to be is due to an invalid assigned value or some default styling getting in the way

If your styling is not appearing in the list below, double check that you've imported your stylesheet properly!
