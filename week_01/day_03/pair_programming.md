# Pair Programming

## In summary

Pair programming is two engineers, working together, on the same code.

## Why would we work this way?
Regrettably, there isn't a lot of scienfitic research on pair programming. However, what there is broadly agrees that although there may be some development-time cost (possibly up to around 15%...although in some cases, there was none), paired programming brings with it some significant benefits.

Pair programming improves:
- design quality
- reduces defects
- reduces staffing risk
- enhances technical skills
- improves team communications
- is considered more enjoyable (if approached correctly!)

Many businesses use pair programming as a technique to on-board new staff.

There will be many times on this course where students will be expected to work in a pair or group.


## Driver/Navigator

The classic model of paired programming.

- one engineer 'drives' (i.e. types the code)
- the other engineer 'nagivates' (reviews the code, makes suggestions, focuses on the overall direction)
- after an agreed period of time, driver and navigator swap roles
- continue to swap roles throughout


## Pairing remotely
In-person paired programming simply involves two people sharing one laptop.

This obviously requires more thought when we are working remotely.

Eventually, **we will show you a workflow that involes pushing and pulling from a single remote repository**, but for the moment, we will use a plugin for Intellij called CodeTogether.

Let's all install and set up CodeTogether as a group.

**Step 1** [Download the CodeTogether plugin for Intellij](https://www.codetogether.com/download/) ensuring you choose the version for `JetBrains IDEs` (Intellij is made by JetBrains)
**Step 2** [Follow the installation instructions](https://www.codetogether.com/docs/codetogether-for-jetbrains-ides-installation/) and install the zip file you downloaded in Intellij.

> demonstrate how to use CodeTogether with another trainer or student. Most students will have used LiveShare in VSCode during the assessment centre, so should be familiar with the concept of a code-sharing tool like this.

### Things to note about CodeTogether
As we are using CodeTogether's free programme, there are some limitations:

- A maximum of three (3) people can join the session at one time
- Each individual session can last a maximum of 1 hour. When your session ends, just start another one (it could mark a good point to take a short break in the session anyway).

While pair programming, you should **continue to communicate with each other in your breakout room in Zoom**. Do not write code in another file while your partner works elsewhere.

## Anti-patterns
Watch out for anti-patterns. These are things you should avoid doing.

### (Navigator) Leaping on errors too quickly
Constantly pointing out small errors is harmful to the work flow. Give your partner a chance to notice their own typos and correct them.

### (Navigator) Giving low-level instructions
Try to make your suggestions at the highest level that you think your partner will understand. If you are struggling to get your idea across, consider using the annotation tool in Zoom and/or a whiteboarding tool (such as the one in Zoom or Excalidraw). If you need to type on the screen, ask first.

### (Driver) Driving too fast
Don't move through your code so quickly that your partner is unable to follow. This can be difficult even for experienced navigators.


Pair programming is NOT:
- one engineer writing code while the other watches
- two engineers writing code on separate laptops
- silence
- forgetting to swap roles. Each role is tiring in its own way, and swapping can be refreshing in the way change can be refreshing.

## Take breaks
Remember to take a few short breaks! Pairing requires focus and good communication and this can be tiring.
