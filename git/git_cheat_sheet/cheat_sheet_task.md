# Make a Command-Line Cheat Sheat

Both Terminal and Git will be important tools in our careers as software engineers, so understanding them and practicing with them is vital. In this lab we will write a cheat-sheet to summarise what we covered in today's lessons which we can use for future reference.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Create a directory to work in and inside that directory create a new file.
- Initialise a Git repository in the directory then add and commit the file.
- In the file write a list of the commands we worked with today and an explanation of what each one does.
- Commit your changes regularly as you add to your file.
- Create a repository on GitHub and link your local repository to it.
- Push your files to GitHub

## Extensions

- Rewrite your cheat sheet in the [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) format in a `.md` file. GitHub has a built-in interpreter which can display correctly-formatted markdown files, meaning it will be possible to read your cheat sheet clearly in the browser.
- Investigate `.gitignore` files and what they are used for. Try adding one to your repository.
