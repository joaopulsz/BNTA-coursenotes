# Lab - HTML Wireframing

In this lab there are three parts which are all open-ended. For ease of submission of the associated form, please consider the following as MVP:

- "I have spent some time with some of the official accessibility documents, familiarising myself with what is meant by _best practice_"
- "I understand the need to consider accessibility on the web and have read the introductory WCAG documentation"
- "I have envisioned a website and detailed this vision in a markdown document to be pushed to a GitHub repo, including an image of my wireframe"
- "I have begun, _but not necessarily completed_, creating the HTML structure of said website"

We appreciate that it may be difficult to gauge what constitutes further progress towards the usual context of _Extensions_ for this lab. Do not worry about this scoring, your self-reflection score for how comfortable you are with this content is far more important.


## Part I: Accessibility Research and Review

Take some time to look through UK accessibility guidelines and to familiarise yourself with the requirements WACG 2.1.

- [Accessibility Requirements for Public Sector Websites and Apps](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)
- [Understanding WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag)
- [BNTA Textbook: some notes on HTML-CSS-JS, Accessibility and Responsive Design](https://brightnetwork-technology-academy.github.io/curriculum/html_css/lessons/intro_to_html_css/intro/)


## Part II: Envisioning Your Site

Please put your working for this step within a markdown (`.md`) file which is also pushed to your repo.

- Think of a theme or topic to base your website around
- Begin describing key design elements within your website, describe each (_e.g._ "I want a list of product cards each showing a type of shoe and a short description" or "I want a large splash-image at the top, with some overlapping introductory text!")
- Draw out a wireframe either on paper or using your chosen online tool, placing images of these into your markdown file

We strongly encourage that you include at minimum one design element which requires **horizontal organisation** of content within the page. This is so we have a place to easily add CSS Flexbox and/or Grid come the following lab.

If you're struggling for ideas: consider building up a small shop, a personal blog or simply a single-page website encouraging others to get in on one of your favourite hobbies.


## Part III: Create Your Own Website

Realise your design! You've already got your plan, it's time to start building

- Using your wireframe from the last step, consider how the structure of your webpage will look, and start coding!

Code your site using **semantic HTML ONLY!** Don’t be tempted to add CSS or to embed functionality in the website. You will have the chance to add CSS to this site in the following lab

This does mean that your website won't be entirely, visually, representative of your wireframe, however remember that the HTML code defines the _framework or layout_ of your site; the structural base, not the end design. Before we start adding in styling, we need to ensure that we have a solid, logical structure

Before you start, take a bit of time to look at the HTML tags available to you—there are probably more than you think. Check out the [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [HTML Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) for starters


## To Submit

For this lab, please submit both a markdown document, including image(s) of a wireframe diagram, and the HTML document which was built with this wireframe in mind

As a reminder: this is a **HTML only lab**, you should not add any CSS to your document during this lab
