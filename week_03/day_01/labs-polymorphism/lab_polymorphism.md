# Java Polymorphism Exercises

We've learned about polymorphism in class, now put that knowledge to use!

## MVP

### 1. Please create a new project, with multiple classes

Use your own concept - don't simply duplicate the examples used in the lessons, or on the textbook. You could use absolutely any inspiration, as long as it involves types and sub-types. Some examples of the kind of relationships you could use, to help get the creative cogs moving:

 - **Book**, **Magazine** and **Newspaper** could be considered concrete sub-types of an abstract **Publication** type.
 - **Bungalow**, **Garage**, and **Castle** could be considered concrete sub-types of an abstract **Building** type.
 - You get the idea...

**Note: Use UML to plan your concept first, then check with a trainer for concept approval <ins>before</ins> you proceed with the coding phase**

### 2. Create an abstract class

Your example doesn't have to be real-world, but it should have at least some internal logic to it.

### 3. Extend the abstract class with at least 2 sub-classes

The relationship should make sense (see examples given above).

### 4. Create a collection which accepts objects of either of those 2 types

This can be an ArrayList, a Set, a HashMap. Whatever makes sense in your concept.

## Extensions

### 5. Implement at least 1 method overload

Demonstrate how you can have more than one implementation of the same method in a class.

### 6: Define an abstract method in the super-class and implement it in each of the sub-classes. 
Alternatively, define a method in the interface (see below) and implement it in those classes which implement the interface.

### 7 Create an interface and implement it on at least 1 class

Also, use the interface you create as the type of a variable somewhere in your project. New up an object from a class that implements the interface.
